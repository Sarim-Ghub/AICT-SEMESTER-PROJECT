      <span class="subtitle">WHO WE ARE</span>
      <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>
        shajar was born from a shared concern about the future of our planet. We 
        saw that many businesses wanted to reduce their carbon footprint but were 
        held back by unclear, unreliable options.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of transparency and verifiable results made it hard to take 
        meaningful action. Determined to find a better way, we combined our 
        expertise in sustainability and technology to create shajar.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to offer a solution that not only helps the environment but also 
        provides businesses with clear proof of their impact. By pinpointing the exact 
        tree responsible for each kilogram of absorbed CO<sub>2</sub>, we make carbon 
        offsetting tangible and trustworthy.

      <h2>Backed by Science and Verified Standards</h2>
      <p class="description">
        At shajar, we prioritize transparency and accountability, which is why we developed our own certification method, the Global Carbon Standard (GCS). Unlike existing standards like Verra and Gold Standard, our system ensures maximum transparency and traceability, with all data securely recorded in an immutable system.
