      <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>
        shajar was born from a shared concern about the future of our planet. We 
        saw that many businesses wanted to reduce their carbon footprint but were 
        held back by unclear, unreliable options.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of transparency and verifiable results made it hard to take 
        meaningful action. Determined to find a better way, we combined our 
        expertise in sustainability and technology to create shajar.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to offer a solution that not only helps the environment but also 
        provides businesses with clear proof of their impact. By pinpointing the exact 
        tree responsible for each kilogram of absorbed CO<sub>2</sub>, we make carbon 
        offsetting tangible and trustworthy.
